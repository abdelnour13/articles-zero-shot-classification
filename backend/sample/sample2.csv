20149,"  Let $n$ and $k$ be natural numbers such that $2^k < n$. We study the
restriction to $\mathfrak{S}_{n-2^k}$ of odd-degree irreducible characters of
the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. This analysis completes the study begun
in [Ayyer A., Prasad A., Spallone S., Sem. Lothar. Combin. 75 (2015), Art.
B75g, 13 pages] and recently developed in [Isaacs I.M., Navarro G., Olsson
J.B., Tiep P.H., J. Algebra 478 (2017), 271-282].
